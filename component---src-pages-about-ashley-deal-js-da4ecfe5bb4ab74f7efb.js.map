She brought a focus on building strong client relationships, and a dedication to completing projects where the results speak for themselves.\n      </SectionP>\n      <SectionP>\n        Through her work, Ashley aims to create compelling stories from complex information and abstract data, and transform confusing or frustrating processes into smooth, seamless interactions. She has extensive background designing communications and interactive experiences that communicate information effectively, inspire action, and drive positive behaviors.\n      </SectionP>\n      <SectionP>\n        Ashley’s career as an information and interaction designer includes considerable experience in education, healthcare, and design research for new product development. The underlying thread through her body of work is helping people understand each other, and helping them access and internalize important information they need to make critical decisions.\n      </SectionP>\n      <SectionP>\n        Ashley holds a Bachelor of Arts from Vanderbilt University, and a Masters in Design from Carnegie Mellon University, where she has been an adjunct faculty member in the School of Design since 2015.

She respects precision and craft. You’re just as likely to find her asking “Why does it matter?” as “How should it be?”\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            Ashley is always absorbing and synthesizing new information, ideas, and perspectives, culling across domains and her own experience to spark ideas for a project.
